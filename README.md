## 🚀 About the Project
Color Guesser Pro is an interactive web-based game where you test your color perception skills! 🎯  
- A random RGB color is generated as the **target**.  
- Use sliders to mix your own RGB values and try to match it as closely as possible.  
- Submit your guess to see your accuracy score, and beat your high score!  

Perfect for designers, artists, or anyone who loves a challenge. No frameworks needed – just vanilla web tech! 💻
